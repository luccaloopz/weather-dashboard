## **Description**
The purpose of this project is to create a weather dashboard that uses a weather API to retrieve weather data for a specific city around the world. When users search for a city, they are displayed with two separate blocks of information. The first block inludes the weather data for that city currently. The second block includes a 5-day forecast for the next 5 days.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## **Application**

Basic functionality of the webpage:

A key part of the functionality of this application was the search bar/history section. As you can see below, once the user searches for a particular city, it is then populated within the search history list. The search history list therefore includes all of the cities that the user has searched for thus far. The search history persists across sessions. Meaning, if the page is reloaded, the search history list buttons will still be present and clicking on each of them will bring the user to that city's weather data once again.
